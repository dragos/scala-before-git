                  How to build and run the Scala applications
                       targeted at the Android platform
================================================================================


In this document we describe the usage of the Apache Ant tool (ant.apache.org/)
to build and run the featured Scala applications on an Android device.

The directory structure is the following :

    unlocking-android/
        bin/
             emulator
             emulator-maps
        configs/
             ant-windows.properties
             ant-unix.properties
             build-scala.xml
        build.properties
        build.xml
        README.txt
        USAGE.txt
        <android-project-directory>/

The "unlocking-android/build.xml" Ant script features the following targets :

help:
     [echo] Android Ant Build. Available targets:
     [echo]    help:          Displays this help.
     [echo]    clean:         Removes output files created by other targets.
     [echo]    compile:       Compiles project's .java files into .class files.
     [echo]    scala-compile: Compiles project's .scala files into .class files.
     [echo]    debug:         Builds the application and signs it with a debug key.
     [echo]    release:       Builds the application. The generated apk file must be
     [echo]                   signed before it is published.
     [echo]    uninstall:     Uninstalls the application from a running emulator or
     [echo]                   device.
     [echo] Available advanced targets:
     [echo]    setenv:        Updates build files in project directories with
     [echo]                   Scala-specific data stored in the configs directory.
     [echo]    check-maps:    Checks configuration settings of projects
     [echo]                   depending on the Google APIs.

In addition the usual targets available in standard Android projects we also
supports the "scala-compile" target as well as the advanced targets "setenv"
and "check-maps".

    * The "scala-compile" target depends on the "compile" target and compiles
      project's .scala files into .class files.

    * The "setenv" target uses the configuration settings found in the
      "configs/" directory and updates the files "build.properties" and
      "build-scala.xml" in each project directory.

    * The "check-maps" target checks the consistency of the configuration
      settings for the Google's APIs (e.g. maps.jar) defined in the files
      "AndroidManifest.xml" and "default.properties" together with the
      environment settings of the Android emulator (or device).


Have fun!
