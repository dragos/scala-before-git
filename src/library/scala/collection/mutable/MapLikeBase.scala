/** The reason for this class is so that we can
 *  have both a generic immutable `+` with signature
 *
 *    def + [B1 >: B](kv: (A, B1)): Map[A, B1]
 *
 *  and a (deprecated) mutable `+` of signature
 *
 *    def + (kv: (A, B)): this.type = this += kv
 *
 *  The former is required to fulfill the Map contract.
 *  The latter is required for backwards compatibility.
 *  We can't have both methods in the same class, as that would give a double definition.
 *  They are OK in different classes though, and narrowly escape a `same erasure' problem.
 *  Once the deprecated + goes away we can do without class MapLikeBase.
