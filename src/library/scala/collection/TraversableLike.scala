/** A template trait for traversable collections.
 *  This is a base trait of all kinds of Scala collections. It implements
 *  the behavior common to all collections, in terms of a method
 *  `foreach` with signature:
 *  {{{
 *     def foreach[U](f: Elem => U): Unit</pre>
 *  }}}
 *  Collection classes mixing in this trait provide a concrete 
 *  `foreach` method which traverses all the
 *  elements contained in the collection, applying a given function to each.
 *  They also need to provide a method `newBuilder`
 *  which creates a builder for collections of the same kind.
 *  
 *  A traversable class might or might not have two properties: strictness
 *  and orderedness. Neither is represented as a type.
 *  
 *  The instances of a strict collection class have all their elements
 *  computed before they can be used as values. By contrast, instances of
 *  a non-strict collection class may defer computation of some of their
 *  elements until after the instance is available as a value.
 *  A typical example of a non-strict collection class is a
 *  <a href="../immutable/Stream.html" target="ContentFrame">
 *  `scala.collection.immutable.Stream`</a>.
 *  A more general class of examples are `TraversableViews`.
 *  
 *  If a collection is an instance of an ordered collection class, traversing
 *  its elements with `foreach` will always visit elements in the
 *  same order, even for different runs of the program. If the class is not
 *  ordered, `foreach` can visit elements in different orders for
 *  different runs (but it will keep the same order in the same run).'
 * 
 *  A typical example of a collection class which is not ordered is a
 *  `HashMap` of objects. The traversal order for hash maps will
 *  depend on the hash codes of its elements, and these hash codes might
 *  differ from one run to the next. By contrast, a `LinkedHashMap`
 *  is ordered because it's `foreach` method visits elements in the
 *  order they were inserted into the `HashMap`.

 *    which means that an implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]`
 *    is found.
 *  @define bfinfo an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the
