  /** Access level encoding: there are three scala flags (PRIVATE, PROTECTED,
   *  and LOCAL) which combine with value privateWithin (the "foo" in private[foo])
   *  to define from where an entity can be accessed.  The meanings are as follows:
   *
   *  PRIVATE     access restricted to class only.
   *  PROTECTED   access restricted to class and subclasses only.
   *  LOCAL       can only be set in conjunction with PRIVATE or PROTECTED.
   *              Further restricts access to the same object instance.
   *
   *  In addition, privateWithin can be used to set a visibility barrier.
   *  When set, everything contained in the named enclosing package or class
   *  has access.  It is incompatible with PRIVATE or LOCAL, but is additive
   *  with PROTECTED (i.e. if either the flags or privateWithin allow access,
   *  then it is allowed.)
   *
   *  The java access levels translate as follows:
   *
   *  java private:     hasFlag(PRIVATE)                && !hasAccessBoundary
   *  java package:     !hasFlag(PRIVATE | PROTECTED)   && (privateWithin == enclosing package)
   *  java protected:   hasFlag(PROTECTED)              && (privateWithin == enclosing package)
   *  java public:      !hasFlag(PRIVATE | PROTECTED)   && !hasAccessBoundary
