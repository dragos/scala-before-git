  /** "The Mixture Rule"

        {v=pat1, pats1 .. } {q1} 
  match {..               } {..} 
        {v=patn, patsn .. } {qn} 

  The is the real work-horse of the algorithm. There is some column whose top-most pattern is a 
  constructor. (Forsimplicity, itisdepicted above asthe left-most column, but anycolumn will do.) 
  The goal is to build a test state with the variablevand some outgoing arcs (one for each construc- 
  tor and possibly a default arc). Foreach constructorcin the selected column, its arc is deﬁned as 
  follows: 

  Let {i1,...,ij} be the rows-indices of the patterns in the column that match c. Since the pat- 
  terns are viewed as regular expressions, this will be the indices of the patterns that either 
  have the same constructor c, or are wildcards. 

  Let {pat1,...,patj} be the patterns in the column corresponding to the indices computed 
  above, and let nbe the arity of the constructor c, i.e. the number of sub-patterns it has. For 
  eachpati, its n sub-patterns are extracted; if pat i is a wildcard, nwildcards are produced 
  instead, each tagged with the right path variable. This results in a pattern matrix with n 
  columns and j rows. This matrix is then appended to the result of selecting, from each col- 
  umn in the rest of the original matrix, those rows whose indices are in {i1,...,ij}. Finally 
  the indices are used to select the corresponding ﬁnal states that go with these rows. Note 
  that the order of the indices is signiﬁcant; selected rows do not change their relative orders. 
  The arc for the constructor c is now deﬁned as (c’,state), where c’ is cwith any 
  immediate sub-patterns replaced by their path variables (thus c’ is a simple pattern), and 
  state is the result of recursively applying match to the new matrix and the new sequence 
  of ﬁnal states. 

  Finally, the possibility for matching failure is considered. If the set of constructors is exhaustive, 
  then no more arcs are computed. Otherwise, a default arc(_,state)is the last arc. If there are 
  any wildcard patterns in the selected column, then their rows are selected from the rest of the 
  matrix and the ﬁnal states, and the state is the result of applying match to the new matrix and 
  states. Otherwise,the error state is used after its reference count has been incremented.
